Google Calendar Automatic Scheduler 

1. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Enable Google Calendar API and download `credentials.json`. You can refer to [this](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project).

* The Google Calendar access token periodically expires. To fix this, you can manually delete `token.json` from the folder and restart the script.
